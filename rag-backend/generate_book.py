# Introduction to Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence

## Learning Objectives
- Define Physical AI and its distinction from Generative AI.
- Understand the concept of Embodied Intelligence.
- Explore the history and future of Humanoid Robotics.

## What is Physical AI?
Physical AI refers to AI systems that interact with the physical world. Unlike chatbots (like ChatGPT) that process text, Physical AI agents (robots) must perceive, reason, and act in dynamic environments.

### Key Components
1. **Perception**: Sensors (Cameras, LiDAR, IMU).
2. **Reasoning**: Planning, Navigation, Decision Making.
3. **Actuation**: Motors, Servos, Hydraulics.

## Embodied Intelligence
Embodied intelligence suggests that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent's body and its environment. A robot's morphology (shape) influences how it learns.

## Quiz
1. What is the main difference between GenAI and Physical AI?
   - A) GenAI is smarter.
   - B) Physical AI interacts with the physical world.
   - C) GenAI uses robots.
   
   **Answer: B**

## Lab: Setting up your Environment
1. Install ROS 2 Humble.
2. Install Docker.
3. Run the `hello_world` node.

# Humanoid Robotics Landscape

## Overview
Humanoid robots are designed to resemble the human body. This allows them to operate in environments built for humans (stairs, doors, tools).

## Leading Platforms
| Robot | Company | Key Features |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| Optimus | Tesla | Mass manufacturing focus, VLA |
| Atlas | Boston Dynamics | Hydraulic (retired), Electric (new) |
| Figure 01 | Figure | OpenAI integration |
| Digit | Agility Robotics | Logistics focus |

## Challenges
- **Balance**: Bipedal locomotion is unstable.
- **Power**: Battery life is limited.
- **Cost**: Actuators and sensors are expensive.

## Lab: Analyze a URDF
We will look at a simple Humanoid URDF file.
```xml
<robot name="simple_humanoid">
  <link name="torso">
    <visual>
      <geometry>
        <box size="0.3 0.1 0.5"/>
      </geometry>
    </visual>
  </link>
</robot>
```

# ROS 2 Fundamentals

## Nodes, Topics, Services
ROS 2 is the middleware for robotics.

### Nodes
A node is a process that performs computation.
```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

class MyNode(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('my_node')
        self.get_logger().info('Hello ROS 2!')
```

### Topics
Nodes communicate via topics (Pub/Sub).

### Services
Request/Response communication.

## Lab: Create a Publisher
Write a Python node that publishes "Hello World" every second.

# URDF for Humanoids

## Unified Robot Description Format
URDF is an XML format to describe the robot's structure.

## Links and Joints
- **Links**: Rigid bodies (torso, arm, leg).
- **Joints**: Connections (revolute, prismatic, fixed).

## Xacro
Macro language to make URDFs cleaner.
