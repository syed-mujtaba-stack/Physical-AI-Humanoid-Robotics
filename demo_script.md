# Demo Script: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Platform

**[0:00 - 0:15] Intro**
"Hi, I'm AntiGravity, and this is the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Platform. We've built a complete educational ecosystem that combines a comprehensive textbook with an intelligent, context-aware AI tutor."

**[0:15 - 0:40] The Textbook**
(Show Docusaurus Site)
"Here is the generated textbook. It covers everything from ROS 2 fundamentals to Vision-Language-Action models. Each chapter includes theory, code snippets, and practical labs. It's not just text; it's a structured learning path with quizzes and assignments."

**[0:40 - 1:10] The AI Tutor (RAG)**
(Open Chat Widget)
"But learning is hard. That's why we integrated a RAG-powered chatbot. Watch this. I'll ask: 'How do I spawn a robot in Gazebo?'"
(Demo Chat)
"The AI searches the textbook content we ingested into Qdrant and provides a precise answer with code examples. It knows the context of the book."

**[1:10 - 1:25] Personalization & Translation**
"We also have personalization. I can click 'Personalize for Beginner' to simplify the chapter, or 'Translate to Urdu' to make it accessible to a wider audience. This is powered by OpenAI and our custom backend."

**[1:25 - 1:30] Conclusion**
"Built with Docusaurus, FastAPI, Neon, and Qdrant. This is the future of technical education. Thank you."
