# Project Overview

## Description
The Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project is an AI-native educational platform built with Docusaurus and deployed on GitHub Pages. This interactive textbook teaches students how to bridge digital AI agents to physical robots, focusing on embodied intelligence and humanoid robotics.

## Goals
- Teach Physical AI concepts and embodied intelligence principles
- Introduce humanoid robotics using ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, and Vision-Language-Action models
- Prepare students for the era of embodied intelligence
- Enable students to build simulated autonomous humanoid robots with voice commands
- Provide an interactive learning experience with contextual AI assistance

## Target Audience
- Students transitioning from digital AI to physical robotics
- Developers interested in robotics and embodied AI
- Researchers exploring the intersection of AI and physical systems
- Engineers looking to understand modern robotics frameworks

## Key Outcomes
- Students will understand the fundamentals of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Students will be able to build and program simulated autonomous humanoid robots
- Students will gain hands-on experience with ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, and VLA models
- Students will learn to control robots using voice commands and AI integration
- Students will understand hardware requirements for physical implementations
